## Overview

**Transit-Route Twin** is a lightweight service that simulates live bus arrivals and delays by polling a public transit API, storing the results in real time, and broadcasting updates via WebSockets.

Originally built for the Transport for London (TfL) Live Bus Arrivals API, it can be easily adapted for any city's transit system.
