Overview

Transit-Route Twin is a lightweight service that simulates live bus arrivals and delays by polling a public transit API, storing results in real-time, and broadcasting updates over WebSockets. Originally built using the Transport for London Live Bus Arrivals API, it can be extended to any city's transit system with minimal effort.

Features

Real-Time Polling: Periodically fetches next-bus ETAs for a given route.
WebSocket Push: Broadcasts updates to connected clients instantly.
Flexible Frontend: Renders interactive maps or timelines in JavaScript.
Modular Design: Separate polling, storage, and rendering layers for easy customization.
Lightweight & Simple: Single REST call per route; standardized JSON responses; no specialized hardware required.

API_BASE_URL=https://api.tfl.gov.uk/Line/{lineId}/Arrivals
Usage

Start the backend
cd server
npm start
Start the frontend
cd client
npm start
Open your browser at http://localhost:8080 (or configured port)
API Reference

GET /route/:lineId/arrivals
Fetches the latest list of estimated bus arrivals for a given line.
Response: Array of objects containing:
vehicleId
lineId
destinationName
expectedArrival (ISO 8601 timestamp)
timeToStation (in seconds)
How It Works

Polling Service
Periodically sends a GET request to the Transport for London API at:
https://api.tfl.gov.uk/Line/{lineId}/Arrivals
Parses the JSON response and normalizes fields.
Real-Time Store
Maintains an in-memory (or Redis) store of the latest predictions.
Updates only when there are changes to avoid unnecessary broadcasts.
WebSocket Broadcaster
On store update, emits events to all subscribed WebSocket clients.
Clients can subscribe to one or more lineIds.
Frontend Renderer
Connects to the WebSocket endpoint.
Receives live updates and renders them:
Map View: Pins on a map showing approaching buses.
Timeline View: A horizontal timeline representing upcoming arrivals.
